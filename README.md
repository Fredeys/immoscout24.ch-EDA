# Immoscout24.ch EDA

Welcome to the Immoscout24.ch Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project aims to analyze and present key insights from the data I scraped from [Immoscout24.ch](https://www.immoscout24.ch/de/immobilien/mieten/land-schweiz-fl) using the [Immoscout24-scraper](https://github.com/Fredeys/immoscout24-scraper). 

## Project Description

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the information I collected and highlight key insights about the rental property market in Switzerland. Using various data visualization techniques and linear regression, we delve into the trends and characteristics of the properties listed on Immoscout24.ch.

## Data Source

The data for this project was scraped from [Immoscout24.ch](https://www.immoscout24.ch/de/immobilien/mieten/land-schweiz-fl).

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook).
3. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Main Features

- **Data Visualization**: I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations.
- **Linear Regression**: A linear regression model is applied to predict price trends.
- **Customized Plots**: The visualizations are customized with selected colors for better clarity and presentation.

## Visualizations

- Matplotlib and Seaborn plots are extensively used to visualize the data.
- Trend analysis using linear regression is showcased.

## Key Insights

- There is a focus on modern apartments with at least 2.5 rooms.
- These apartments typically have good access to highways or public transport and are close to schools and kindergartens.
- Older apartments are often renovated to modern standards.
